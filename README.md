### Stakeholder: Victoria Huang

Victoria an active climber who seeks to improve her climbing skills.
Victoria's goals are:
- Climb a V7 [^1]
- Do a pistol squat
- Improve on dynos
- Flash more V5s [^2]

Some problems/fustrations Victoria has are:
- She would like a way to key into the gym without needing to present a physical card everytime.
- Identify when the gym is busy/empty, and which sections of the gym is less busy.
- Keep track of her progress
- Have a way to tag routes with the skillset needed to send them, so she knows where to go to practice certain skills. [^3]

[^1]: The V scale grading describes the difficulty of a route. The higher the number, the higher the route.
[^2]: The term "flash" in climbing means to complete a route on the first attempt.
[^3]: The term "send" in climbing means to complete a route.
